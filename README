This project is the application for my CHIPbot.

The chipbot is a little robot build with a CHIP (9$ arm computer) and driven by the PocketCHIP.
In the sources folder wee found the source code for the client and the server application.
In the hardware folder wee found the plan for the CHIP shield on the robot.
